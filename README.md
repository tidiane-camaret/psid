# PSID on EEG + Behavioral time series


The psid_accuracy.py script allows to train a PSID + LDA pipeline on EEG data for behavioral state classification. 


# Hyperparameter optimisation

It is also possible to perform HPO on on PSID n1, nx and i parameters with a given dataset, by using the psid_hpo.py script.
HPO uses the BOHB library
